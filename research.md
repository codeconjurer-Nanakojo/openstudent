# A Strategic and Technical Blueprint for OpenStudent

## Executive Summary: The OpenStudent Blueprint

This report outlines a strategic and technical blueprint for OpenStudent, an academic archive designed for and by students. The project's foundation is a modern, serverless technology stack composed of Supabase for a PostgreSQL database, user authentication, and file storage, GitHub Pages for static web hosting, and ImageKit.io for optimized media delivery. This combination is highly suitable for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) requiring zero immediate financial investment.

The proposed MVP is a functional, read-only public archive with a secure, authenticated submission workflow for new academic papers. Its technical architecture is built on three core principles: simplicity of implementation, clarity of function, and extensibility for future growth.

The primary recommendations for the solo founder are to prioritize the implementation of a robust and explicit Row Level Security (RLS) model from the outset and to design the database schema to be flexible and "future-proof."

## 1. MVP Definition & Foundational Architecture

### 1.1. Core MVP Features

- **Read-Only Public Archive**: A public-facing website displaying a gallery of submitted academic papers, accessible to all users
- **Contributor Submission Workflow**: Secure submission process for authenticated users to upload new documents
- **Simple Search and Filter**: Basic keyword search on title/abstract and filtering by discipline
- **User Profiles**: Basic profile system linking submissions to contributors

### 1.2. Technical Stack Analysis: Free-Tier Viability and Constraints

| Service | Free Plan | Key Features | Critical Limits | Strategic Role |
|---------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Supabase** | $0/month | Postgres DB, Auth, Storage, Instant APIs, Realtime | 500 MB DB, 1 GB file storage, 50k MAUs, 5 GB egress, 1-week inactivity pause, 2 projects per organization | Core backend, data, authentication, and file storage for documents |
| **GitHub Pages** | Free | Static site hosting, custom domains, HTTPS | 1 GB site size, 100 GB/month soft bandwidth limit, static content only | Primary host for the HTML/CSS/JS front-end |
| **ImageKit.io** | $0/month | Image CDN, transformations, optimization | 20 GB bandwidth, 3 GB DAM storage, 2 user seats | Image optimization and delivery for thumbnails, avatars, etc. Does not handle PDFs |

## 2. The Core Systems: Data, Security, & Frontend

### 2.1. Database Schema & Architecture

The database schema uses a normalized approach with "narrow tables" to reduce data duplication and allow for easy expansion.

**Proposed Tables:**
- `profiles`: User-specific data linked to Supabase's auth.users
- `documents`: Central table for academic papers with full-text search capability
- `tags` and `categories`: Flexible taxonomy system with many-to-many relationships

**Database Architecture Diagram:**
```
auth.users → 1:1 → public.profiles → 1:N → public.documents → N:M → public.document_tags → N:1 → public.tags/categories
```

### 2.2. A Robust Security Model with RLS

Row Level Security (RLS) is implemented to enforce access control at the database layer:

**Policies for documents table:**
- `FOR SELECT`: Allow all users (anon and authenticated) to read documents
- `FOR INSERT`: Allow authenticated users to insert documents where `auth.uid() = author_id`
- `FOR UPDATE/DELETE`: Allow users to modify only their own contributions

### 2.3. Frontend & Submission Workflow

- Static frontend hosted on GitHub Pages using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- Dynamic functionality powered by supabase-js client library
- Authentication handled client-side via Supabase Auth
- Document submission process: metadata form → PDF upload → database insert

## 3. Strategic Roadmap & Scaling Insights

### 3.1. Phased Feature Breakdown

**Phase 1 (MVP Launch):**
- Public archive, authenticated user submission, basic keyword search, simple user profiles

**Phase 2 (Collaborative Archive):**
- Advanced taxonomy management, peer-review system, expanded user profiles, admin dashboard

**Phase 3 (Scaling & Advanced Features):**
- Hybrid search implementation, real-time analytics, email notifications

### 3.2. Community & Collaboration Model

| Role | Documents (CRUD) | Comments (CRUD) | Tags (CRUD) |
|------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Student** | Read All | Insert Own, Read All | Read All |
| **Contributor** | Read All, Insert Own, Update Own | Insert Own, Read All, Update Own | Read All |
| **Moderator** | Read All, Update All, Delete All | Insert All, Read All, Update All, Delete All | Read All, Insert All, Update All, Delete All |
| **Admin** | Read All, Insert All, Update All, Delete All | Insert All, Read All, Update All, Delete All | Read All, Insert All, Update All, Delete All |

### 3.3. Performance & Cost Optimization

- Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to identify and optimize slow queries
- Add indexes to frequently queried columns
- Implement automated "keep-alive" script to prevent inactivity pauses
- Store large files in Supabase Storage, not database
- Continuously monitor resource usage

## 4. Best Practices & Research Suggestions

### 4.1. The Solo Founder's Playbook

- Adopt modular code organization with dedicated services directory
- Use Supabase CLI for local development and database migrations
- Leverage Supabase Studio dashboard for visual management

### 4.2. Usability & Discovery

**Search Engine Optimization (SEO):**
- Optimize page titles and meta descriptions
- Strategic keyword placement in abstracts (3-6 times)
- Descriptive filenames and alt text for images
- High-quality internal and external linking

**Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG):**
- Proper HTML heading structures and logical reading order
- Sufficient color contrast ratio (at least 4.5:1)
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Descriptive alt text for all informative images

### 4.3. Future Research Directions

- Community governance models of student-led open-source projects
- External analytics services integration (e.g., Tinybird)
- Supabase Edge Function optimization for AI embeddings

## Conclusion

The OpenStudent project is highly viable on the chosen free-tier technology stack. By prioritizing a phased development approach and a foundational architecture that anticipates future needs, the solo founder can effectively build and launch a robust MVP. The cornerstone of this strategy is the intelligent use of Supabase's features, particularly its Row Level Security, which enables a secure, multi-user application without the complexity or cost of a dedicated server.
