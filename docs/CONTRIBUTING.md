 ## Database Changes: Required Workflow
 
 All schema changes are managed with Supabase migrations. Do not edit `backend/db/schema.sql` directly.
 
 ### Prerequisites
 
 - Supabase CLI installed
 - Local Supabase services running (via `supabase start` if needed)
 
 ### Create a Migration
 
 1. Generate a new migration file:
    - `supabase migration new <short_change_name>`
 2. Add SQL to the generated file in `supabase/migrations/`.
 3. Apply locally and load seed data:
    - `supabase db reset`
 4. Verify:
    - Schema builds without errors
    - Seed data from `supabase/seed.sql` loads
    - App boots and core flows (auth, RLS, uploads, analytics) work
 5. Commit your migration files and push PR.
 
 ### Baseline and Seed
 
 - Baseline schema is captured in `supabase/migrations/*baseline_schema_part*.sql`.
 - Seed data lives in `supabase/seed.sql` and includes:
   - Admin: `admin@example.com`
   - Contributor: `contrib@example.com`
   - One university, program, course, and project
 
 ### Rules of Thumb
 
 - Keep migrations small and focused.
 - If you need data migrations, include them in the same migration or a follow-up one.
 - Never rewrite history on migrations already merged to the default branch.
 - Prefer explicit forward-only SQL (avoid destructive drops unless intended and reviewed).
 
 ### RLS and Policies
 
 - Add RLS policies in migrations.
 - Ensure `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` is present when introducing a new table with policies.
 - Test common access cases locally after `supabase db reset`.
 
 ### Generated Artifact: schema.sql
 
 - `backend/db/schema.sql` is treated as a generated, read-only artifact if kept for reference.
 - Do not edit this file manually. Regenerate from applied migrations if needed.
 
 ### Verification Commands
 
 - Reset DB from migrations and run seed: `supabase db reset`
 - Create a new migration: `supabase migration new <name>`
 
 ### Code Review Checklist (DB)
 
 - Migration adds only the intended changes
 - RLS and policies are correct and secure by default
 - Seed data unaffected (or updated appropriately)
 - README and this file remain accurate
