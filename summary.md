## 🧩 Development Strategy

We’re building **step by step**, one page at a time:

1. `login.html` → Auth flow
2. `add_project.html` → Submission form
3. `admin.html` → Moderation dashboard
4. `projects.html` → Public archive
5. `profile.html` → Contributor page
6. `blog/index.html` → Blog listing
7. `analytics.html` → Admin stats
8. `withdrawals.html` → Contributor payout requests

Each page connects to `supabase.js`, `imagekit.js`, and backend logic as needed.
